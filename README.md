This is an undergraduate graduation design project, the purpose is to get familiar with point cloud segmentation and lay a foundation for further study in this field.
# Execution specification
By setting the point cloud file path and parameters(residuals, visualization, evaluation), we can directly run the main.py file to achieve point cloud segmentation.
